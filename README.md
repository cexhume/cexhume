# **Hi there**
###### here's a little about me:

 My name is Carl and I'm a student in Engr 102
 
 My major is chemical engineering and this class counts as a technical elective for me
 
 I'm interested in data science and its applications in many fields. I've also always been interested
 in coding and saw this class as a good way to get an introduction.
 
 Right now I'm working on my senior projects and finishing up my remaining classes
